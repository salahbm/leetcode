Example Walkthrough
Let's consider an example nums array to illustrate the solution approach:

nums = [2, -1, -2, 3, -4]
We want to find the maximum absolute sum of any subarray of this array.

Initialize f and g to 0. f is the maximum subarray sum so far, and g is the minimum subarray sum so far. Also, initialize ans to 0, which will hold the final answer.
Start iterating over the nums array.
First element is 2:

Update f: f = max(0, 0) + 2 = 2
Update g: g = min(0, 0) + 2 = 2
Update ans: ans = max(0, 2, abs(2)) = 2
Second element is -1:

Update f: f = max(2, 0) - 1 = 1
Update g: g = min(2, 0) - 1 = -1
Update ans: ans = max(2, 1, abs(-1)) = 2
Third element is -2:

Update f: f = max(1, 0) - 2 = -1 (But since f is now less than 0, we reset it to 0)
Update g: g = min(-1, 0) - 2 = -3
Update ans: ans = max(2, 0, abs(-3)) = 3
Fourth element is 3:

Update f: f = max(0, 0) + 3 = 3
Update g: g = min(-3, 0) + 3 = 0 (But since g would become positive, we reset it to 0)
Update ans: ans = max(3, 3, abs(0)) = 3
Fifth element is -4:

Update f: f = max(3, 0) - 4 = -1 (Again, reset f to 0 since it's less than 0)
Update g: g = min(0, 0) - 4 = -4
Update ans: ans = max(3, 0, abs(-4)) = 4
After iterating through the entire array, the final answer (ans) is 4, which is the maximum absolute sum of any subarray in nums.
Thus, in this example, the maximum absolute sum is 4, obtained from the subarray [-4] whose absolute sum is abs(-4) = 4.
